			When I was in my elementary years, I had studied at <strong> Punta Princesa Elementary School </strong>, all I ever thought was to have fun, play outdoor activities with friends and play toys. Back then, life was so simple and easy, it was very fun, happy and stress-free. I was so naive and innocent, ignorant of the real world. During my late years at elementary school, I was blessed with twin sisters, Cherzyle and Chrizyle, and I was so happy and excited that I would not show up at school just so I could take care of them and play with them. I didn't really like school back then but even though it was the case, I still got good grades and would still belong in the top achievers in class <small> ( AN: perhaps I was simply too smart ^ᵕ^ ) </small> .I was also sometimes bullied because of my height and I easily get scared or intimidated by teachers and other students that's why I didn't like school so much.

			I studied at <strong> Abellana National School </strong> when I was in my Junior High School years for 3 years and on my last year I transferred at <strong> University of San Carlos South Campus </strong>.For me, my highschool life was the best, I learned a lot of things and was able to do a lot of things, my talents and other abilities started to sprout. My highschool years was so fun and enjoyable. I had wonderful classmates and friends, and also met a lot of people. I started gaining confidence because my mind and body had grown which resulted me being <em> effortlessly attractive</em> ( ◞⁽˙³˙⁾~ ). I liked going to school so much and I participated a lot in class and had very good grades. Most of my personality today was developed through my experiences in junior high school. I also had embarassing moments in my junior highschool, as well as very bad decisions which my friends and I could reminisce and laugh to it. <br>

			I studied at <strong> University of Cebu - Main Campus </strong> during my Senior High School years. I studied there for 2 years and I took up STEM. I had spent most of my senior high school facing the screen of my computer and my cellphone. I could say it was the worst ever because I had to stay home because of COVID. I was at the end of my 10th grade when COVID spread like wildfire in the Philippines so I had to stay home and away from people aside from my family. So basically all of my memories at this stage of my life were mostly about online class which was very difficult and stressful at first. I was on the same page with the other students that said they didn't learn much in online class. Even though, it was very difficult during the start, I started to get used to it at a later time but still the gap in efficiency between face to face classes and online classes was really big. Honestly, I prefer online class in terms of convinience, it was easy going in and out of class and <del> I can make use of lag, internet and electricity problems	as an excuse for not being in class. </del> I liked some of my classmates and teachers as well and bonded with them in class. I was less  participative in class during those times and was mainly focused in playing <i> online games, watching anime and reading light novels.</i> Even so, I still scored good marks and got good grades, <em> I graduated Senior High School in UC with </em> <strong> High Honors</strong>. Additionally, I also got a <strong> girlfriend </strong> during my 12th year. She's the prettiest and she's all I could ever ask for that's why I'm beyond grateful for her. If ever you're curious about her, her name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hannaniyamari" target="_blank">Hannaniah Marie Vergara</a> and I love her a lot.
